# Seinfield-Calendar
I was reading about the **Seinfield's** technique to improve your productivity. In summary, the technique is bassically mantain work consistently practice a skill
every day. The comedian said:

>"For each day that I do my task of writing, I get to put a big red X over that day. “After a few days you’ll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You’ll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain.”

After read about it,I thought it's a very cool method, but I need a calendar. We are in 21th century and I've never had a calendar in my life, so i tried to use
the Window's calendar but it can't track your progress. Then I went to the Outlook calendar but just was capable to set meetings and other stuffs.

And i said: **¿Why don't I develop a calendar application with those features?**

So i did it, using **Windows Presentation Fundation** to the UI __(for me is important to say that I'm not a UI expert)__ and **SQLite** to store the progress of the user's. The plan is to use it to track my progress in research and practice programming. However, if you like it, you can use it for any purpose. Every comment is welcome.
